# customer-churn-prediction
End-to-end customer churn prediction using Python with business-focused insights to support customer retention strategies.


## 📌 Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical problem for subscription-based businesses, as retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones.  
In this project, I build an end-to-end machine learning solution to predict customer churn for a telecom company and identify the key drivers behind churn behavior.

The project covers exploratory data analysis (EDA), data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation, with a strong emphasis on translating model results into actionable business insights.
